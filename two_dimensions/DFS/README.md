This module implements a Depth-First Search (DFS) path-finding algorithm. The algorithm explores the maze by recursively expanding the deepest available path before backtracking, effectively generating a full search tree. All mazes used for testing are produced by a ChatGPT-based maze generator. This implementation serves as the first algorithm in a broader project focused on comparing multiple path-finding strategies.
