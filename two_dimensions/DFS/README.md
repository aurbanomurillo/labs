# **Depth-First Search (DFS) Pathfinding Algorithm**

This module provides an object-oriented implementation of the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm for path finding.  
The search systematically explores a maze by expanding the deepest available branch first and performing controlled backtracking when reaching dead ends. This approach effectively constructs a complete search tree of all reachable states.

All test mazes are generated using a custom ChatGPT-based maze generator for reproducible and consistent evaluation.  
This implementation serves as one of the baseline algorithms in a broader project aimed at comparing multiple path-finding strategies under uniform conditions.
