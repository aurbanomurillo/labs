# **Unified Pathfinding Module (All Methods Combined)**

This module consolidates all implemented path-finding algorithms into a single unified interface.  
Its design enables:

- **Side-by-side comparison** of algorithms  
- **Shared data structures** and a common maze abstraction  
- **Consistent benchmarking** across methods  
- **Easy integration** of additional algorithms (e.g., BFS, A*, Dijkstra, Greedy Search)

Each algorithm follows a unified execution pattern and operates on the same grid representation, ensuring interoperability and simplifying testing, profiling, and visualisation workflows.  
This combined module serves as a central point for experimentation and evaluation across all path-finding strategies in the project.
