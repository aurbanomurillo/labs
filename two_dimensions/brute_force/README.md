# **Brute-Force Pathfinding Algorithm**

This module implements a fully exhaustive, brute-force path-finding algorithm using an object-oriented architecture.  
The solver systematically explores every reachable state in the maze without applying heuristics or prioritization rules, making it a useful baseline for comparison.

All mazes used for evaluation are generated with a custom ChatGPT-based maze generator to ensure controlled and reproducible testing conditions.  
This brute-force approach acts as a foundational reference when analysing the performance and behaviour of more advanced path-finding methods.
