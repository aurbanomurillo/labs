# **Pathfinding Algorithms — Comparative Implementations**

This repository gathers multiple path-finding algorithms implemented with a consistent object-oriented design.  
The main objective is to enable a clear comparison of different search strategies under uniform conditions, examining their behaviour across diverse maze configurations.

All mazes are automatically generated using a ChatGPT-based maze generator, ensuring reproducibility and consistent complexity across tests.  
New algorithms will be progressively added to expand the comparative study.
